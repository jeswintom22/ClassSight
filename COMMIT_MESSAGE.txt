feat: Phase 4 API Optimization, UI Overhaul, and Bug Fixes

BREAKING CHANGE: WebSocket endpoint added at `/api/ws/stream`. Frontend updated to use WebSocket for real-time analysis.

Performance & Backend:
- Implemented `CacheService` for OCR and AI results (TTL-based caching)
- Added asynchronous processing for AI calls (`asyncio`) and OCR (`run_in_threadpool`)
- Added image preprocessing (resize/compress) to `ocr_service.py` to speed up analysis
- Fixed JSON serialization error in `ocr_service.py` by casting NumPy types to native Python types
- Added robust error handling and debug logging for OCR/AI pipeline

Frontend & UI/UX:
- Complete UI redesign with Glassmorphism aesthetic
- Moved "Test Mock" button to header for better visibility
- Implemented "Auto-Capture" mode with configurable intervals
- Added "Session History" sidebar with export functionality
- Added "Mock Mode" for offline UI testing and debugging
- Fixed WebSocket connection issues for `file://` protocol usage
- Added CSS/JS cache busting (`?v=2.0`)

Documentation:
- Updated `walkthrough.md` with new features and troubleshooting steps
- Updated `task.md` with completed items
- Updated `implementation_plan.md` with verification results
